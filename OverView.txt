Creating the base set up for a Flask app
this is in order for me to have an initial
set up so I do not need to remake everything
every time I create an app.



Flask Libraries installed:
gunicorn - for Heroku
SQLAlchemy - DB ORM
Flask-Manager - To handle commands
Flask-Migrate - Handle DB migrations
psychogres2 - Postgres db ability
Flask-WTF - For forms
Flask-Testing
Flask-Login
Flask-Assets
